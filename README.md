Frequency counter implemented with ATmega8515, CPLD EPM3064 and SCD5583 display

# Description
This is a small hobby project of a frequency counter implemented with
an ATmega8515, Altera's EPM3064ALC44-10 CPLD and SCD5583 display.

The ATmega8515 microcontroller is clocked with 16 MHz.

The CPLD is used as counter. It is a 10ns type, but I could overclock it up to 180 MHz :)
